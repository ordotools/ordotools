# Database Migration Status

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Schema Creation ✓
- Created new database schema with 6 tables:
  - `countries` - Country metadata
  - `dioceses` - Diocese metadata with country relationships
  - `temporal_feasts` - Temporal feast data (string IDs)
  - `sanctoral_feasts_new` - Sanctoral feast data (numeric IDs)
  - `feast_date_assignments` - Date mappings for sanctoral feasts
  - `translations` - Feast name translations
- Added appropriate indexes for performance
- Kept legacy `sanctoral_feasts` table for backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Data Migration ✓
All migration scripts created and executed successfully:

1. **Countries Migration** (`migrate_countries.py`)
   - Migrated 2 countries (Australia, Spain)
   
2. **Dioceses Migration** (`migrate_dioceses.py`)
   - Migrated 7 dioceses (Roman + 6 local dioceses)
   - Established country relationships
   
3. **Temporal Feasts Migration** (`migrate_temporal.py`)
   - Migrated 744 temporal feasts from `temporal_data.py`
   - All feast properties stored with JSON for complex structures
   
4. **Sanctoral Feasts Migration** (`migrate_sanctoral.py`)
   - Migrated 266 Roman sanctoral feasts
   - Migrated 5 diocese-specific feasts
   - Created date assignments for all feasts
   
5. **Translations Migration** (`migrate_translations.py`)
   - Migrated 2,393 translations
   - 1,149 unique feasts with translations
   - Latin marked as default language

**Migration Statistics:**
```
Countries:                       2
Dioceses:                        7
Temporal Feasts:               744
Roman Sanctoral Feasts:        266
Diocese Sanctoral Feasts:        5
Translations:                 2,393
```

### Phase 3: Repository Classes ✓
Created new repository classes in `/ordotools/tools/repositories/`:

1. **TemporalRepository** (`temporal_repo.py`)
   - `get_feast(feast_id)` - Get single temporal feast
   - `get_all_feasts()` - Get all temporal feasts
   - Converts database rows to feast dictionary format
   - Tested and verified ✓

2. **SanctoralRepository** (`sanctoral_repo.py`)
   - `get_feast(feast_id, diocese_code)` - Get single sanctoral feast
   - `get_feasts_for_date(month, day, diocese_code)` - Get feasts by date
   - `get_year_calendar(diocese_code)` - Get full year calendar
   - Handles both Roman and diocese-specific feasts
   - Tested and verified ✓

3. **DiocesesRepository** (`dioceses_repo.py`)
   - `get_country(code)` - Get country by code
   - `get_diocese(code)` - Get diocese by code
   - `get_all_countries()` / `get_all_dioceses()` - List all
   - `get_dioceses_by_country(country_code)` - Filter by country

4. **TranslationsRepository** (`translations_repo.py`)
   - `get_translation(feast_id, feast_type, language_code)` - Get specific translation
   - `get_all_translations_for_feast(feast_id, feast_type)` - Get all languages
   - `get_default_translation(feast_id, feast_type)` - Get Latin translation
   - `get_translations_by_type(feast_type, language_code)` - Get all for type

### Phase 4: Code Refactoring ✓
Updated core files to use database repositories:

1. **db.py** ✓
   - Updated `init_schema()` with all new tables
   - Added indexes for performance
   - Maintains backward compatibility with legacy table

2. **temporal.py** ✓
   - Removed dependency on `temporal_data.py`
   - Updated `_temporal_data` property to use `TemporalRepository`
   - Date calculation logic preserved
   - Tested and verified ✓

3. **main.py** ✓
   - Removed imports of `Sanctoral` from Python modules
   - Updated `build()` method to use `SanctoralRepository`
   - Uses `TranslationsRepository` for translations
   - Imports verified ✓

4. **sanctoral_repo.py** (old file) ✓
   - Marked as deprecated
   - Kept for backward compatibility

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run full calendar generation tests for multiple years
- [ ] Compare output before/after migration (validation test)
- [ ] Verify all dioceses work correctly
- [ ] Test translations for all supported languages
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Update unit tests in `/tests/` directory

### Phase 6: Web Interface Updates
- [ ] Update `/web_interface/app.py` for new schema
- [ ] Add endpoints for countries (`/api/countries`)
- [ ] Add endpoints for dioceses (`/api/dioceses`)
- [ ] Update browse interface for new structure
- [ ] Add ability to view temporal vs sanctoral feasts separately

### Phase 7: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove obsolete files after thorough testing:
  - `ordotools/tools/temporal_data.py`
  - `ordotools/sanctoral/diocese/*.py` (except `_TEMPLATE.py`)
  - `ordotools/sanctoral/country/*.py` (except `_TEMPLATE.py`)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Update README with new database structure
- [ ] Clean up migration scripts (move to separate directory or archive)

## Known Issues

1. **Rennes Diocese**: Migration failed due to missing country module (`france`)
   - Need to add France country or fix Rennes diocese country reference

2. **Temporal Feast Names**: Currently using IDs as temporary Latin translations
   - Need proper translations for temporal feast names

3. **Testing Required**: Full integration testing needed to ensure:
   - All feasts load correctly
   - Date calculations work properly
   - Commemorations function correctly
   - Translations work for all languages

## Database Schema Notes

- **JSON Usage**: Used sparingly for complex nested structures (mass, office hours)
  - Can be normalized further into separate tables if needed
  - Current structure balances simplicity with flexibility

- **Foreign Keys**: All relationships properly defined with FK constraints
  - Countries → Dioceses (one-to-many)
  - Dioceses → Sanctoral Feasts (one-to-many)
  - Sanctoral Feasts → Date Assignments (one-to-many)

- **Indexes**: Created for:
  - Country/diocese code lookups
  - Feast date queries
  - Translation lookups by feast_id and language

## Migration Scripts Location

All migration scripts are in: `/ordotools/tools/migration_scripts/`

- `migrate_countries.py` - Countries migration
- `migrate_dioceses.py` - Dioceses migration
- `migrate_temporal.py` - Temporal feasts migration
- `migrate_sanctoral.py` - Sanctoral feasts migration
- `migrate_translations.py` - Translations migration
- `run_all_migrations.py` - Master script to run all migrations

To re-run migrations (will replace existing data):
```bash
cd /Users/frbarnes/github/ordotools
source env/bin/activate
python ordotools/tools/migration_scripts/run_all_migrations.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive testing
2. Update web interface
3. Validate all functionality works as expected
4. Clean up obsolete files
5. Update documentation
